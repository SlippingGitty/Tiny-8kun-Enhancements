# Tiny 8kun Enhancements [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/install%20with-stylus-006666?style=flat-square)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SlippingGitty/Tiny-8kun-Enhancements/main/T8E.user.css)
Tiny 8kun Enhancements is a various set of personal CSS snippets strung together to make 8kun look a little less ugly for my liking. This can be installed with the extension Stylus, or through 8Kun's "Theme" tab.

Before use, please select the theme "Tomorrow" in 8kun's theme options menu. 

Mobile users can use the mobile version with by typing `@import url("https://slippinggitty.github.io/MobileT8E.css");` into the themes menu.
