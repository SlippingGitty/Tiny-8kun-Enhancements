# Tiny 8kun Enhancements [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/install%20with-stylus-006666?style=flat-square)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SlippingGitty/Tiny-8kun-Enhancements/main/T8E.user.css)
Tiny 8kun Enhancements is a various set of personal CSS snippets strung together to make 8kun look a little less ugly for my liking. 

Before use, please select the theme "Tomorrow" in 8kun's theme options menu.

What's been done so far: 

* Added a small gradient and box shadow to the favorite boards bar
* Replies now fit the width by 95%, with new color and a rounded border
* The submission text box is hidden on the right until hovered
* Various information has been shifted to the right
* Usernames have been colored 
* Post numbers are underlined
* Photos are rounded by a bit

The future plans:

* Fix obvious issues
