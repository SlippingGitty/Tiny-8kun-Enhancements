# Tiny 8kun Enhancements [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/install%20with-stylus-006666?style=flat-square)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SlippingGitty/Tiny-8kun-Enhancements/main/T8E.user.css)
Tiny 8kun Enhancements is a various set of personal CSS snippets strung together to make 8kun look a little less ugly for my liking. 

Before use, please select the theme "Tomorrow" in 8kun's theme options menu.

So far: 

* Added a small gradient and box shadow to the favorite boards bar
* Replies now fit the width by 95% and have a new color for their border
* The submission text box is hidden on the right until hovered
* Various information has been shifted to the right

Future plans:

* Fix obvious issues
* Makes T8E compatible with other themes
* Add more options in the userstyle settings
